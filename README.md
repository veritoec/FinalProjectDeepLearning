### Music Generation
By Veronica Bruno (230904), Cristina Galvez (230260) and Rafael Bardisa (231142).

#### What is this project?
This is our **final project** for the **Deep Leaning** course at UPF. In it, we study the use of Deep Leaning methods, such as RNNs or LSTMs, for **music generation**. The two main blocks we worked on were
1. **Lyrics generation**: generation of text containing lyrics for songs
    - 'FILES for this part here'
2. **Music generation**: generation of audio corresponding to a generated midi file for a song
   - 'FILES for this part here'
